Full Stack Application with Deep Learning
Top graduation project in BISTU		                                                                                                           
●	Designed and implemented a comprehensive forum system comprising a user-friendly frontend UI for forum and a robust backend system to collect the comments and feedbacks from students and professor and analyze the sentiments.
●	Frontend: Implemented frontend with Vue.js, providing user interface for account registration and comment submission as well as interface for system admin to review and management accounts and posts – such as deleting illegal comments
●	Backend: Developed a backend management system with Java and Spring Boot, interacting with frontend via Rest APIs and stored user information in MySQL. Leveraged Redis to optimize the latency for heavy-read scenario for the system.
●	Sentiment Analysis: Implemented a background job to perform scheduled sentiment analysis running Python scripts based on the user comments and the deep learning algorithm from my own research – Aspect-based Semantic Analysis Based on Deep Learning
